# Introduction
It is well understood that both biotic interactions and abiotic circumstances affect the structure of a community, but their relative importance is still controversial (D’Amen et al. 2018, Delmas et al. 2018, Zurell et al. 2018). Previous researches have described the importance of species interactions in dictating community assemblage and distribution of species ([@Bar-Massada and Belmaker 2017], [@D’Amen et al. 2018]<!--add more-->).  Understanding the importance of biological interactions is critical if we are to predict the distribution of species in face of global changes. 

The most used tools by ecologists for learning distribution patterns of species are Species Distribution Models (SDMs) ([@Zurell et al. 2018]). These models typically use abiotic environmental predictors (e.g. temperature, elevation) alone and do not account for interactions among species. Joint species distribution models, or jSDMs, are an emerging class of models that accounts for patterns of species co-occurrence while controlling for abiotic predictors. Residual correlation among species co-occurrences, random (no association), positive or negative, can then be used to infer associations after accounting for species-specific habitat preferences. 
However, jSDMs usually assume that biotic interactions are stationary over space and environmental settings. This holds a potential pitfall, as estimations of interactions based on fixed relations between species and the environment may result in inaccurate predictions (Pollock et al. 2014, Anderson 2017, Bar-Massada and Belmaker 2017, Delmas et al. 2018 <!--there are more refs to add here if needed-->). There is an plethora of methods to quantify and predict the changes in community assembly (Tikhonov et al. 2017, Clark et al. 2018, Delmas et al. 2018), but most of them do not account for dynamic interactions. 

One approach which can address this challenge uses Markov Random Fields (MRFs) to create networks of interspecies conditional associations ([@Clark et al. 2018]). MRFs are graphic networks which are used in a wide array of disciplines, and increasingly in ecology, to examine the conditional interactions of variables (Azaele et al. 2010, Harris 2016, Clark et al. 2018). This statistical framework allows to create meaningful models from observational presence-absence data, matched with environmental predictors, and to examine directly the conditional association of species among themselves in the context of their environmental setting (figure 1). This is a major enhancement to jSDMs, in which species interactions are only inferred from residual correlations (Harris 2016).
<!-- Moreover, using MRFs allows to compare the coefficients of interactions with the ones of predictors and thus to distinguish between their contributions to patterns of co-occurrence (Clark et al. 2018). -->

Although species interactions inference from co-occurrence networks can be problematic (Peterson et al. 2019), we can learn from previous studies what kind of interactions may result in positive or negative associations and link them.

The Mediterranean Sea contains strong spatio-environmental gradients. Exploring ecological communities along these gradients, may allow us to gain insights into how community interactions change with temperature. The Mediterranean Sea includes Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) whose varying size, protection level and age have been shown to influence local fish populations (Claudet et al. 2006, 2008, Lester et al. 2009) and therefore, can provide another layer of spatial predictors, potentially affecting species (co-)occurrence. 

In this study, I examined the variation in co-occurrence patterns of fish within and outside MPAs and along temperature gradients in the Mediterranean Sea . For this I used graphic networks that account for environmental and anthropogenic covariates.
<!-- I will then asses to what degree co-occurrence patterns are stationary along these two gradients. This will provide an insight onto how ecological communities can function in altered environments, and how protected areas can affect their abilities. -->

## Objectives
1.	To estimate the amount of non-stationarity in interspecific interactions within fish communities across the Mediterranean Sea.
2.	To estimate the amount of non-stationarity in interspecific interactions within fish communities within and outside MPAs.

### Predictions:

1. Temperature effect:
  a. More **positive** associations  
  b. More **negative** associations
  * CREATE A GRAPH (X = TEMPERATURE; Y = SUM OF ASSOCIATIONS or COUNT OF POSITIVE/NEGATIVE ASSOCIATIONS) 
2. MPA effect:
  a. More species/individuals/biomass can be translated to more associations
  b. In biomass model - more associations
  

<!-- This is the focus? Should I add something about the specific dataset? something we can draw from fish, mediterranean, mpas etc?-->

## Insert a figure

## Inset equations
Here is a nifty equation that shows absolutely nothing except how to include an equation: 

<!-- COMMENTS! -->
<!-- The text enclosed in dollar signs $ $ will be treated as LaTex math (an equation), and will be formatted especially for this -->

Amount I wish I could spend on coffee = $\frac{10(coffee\ budget ^ 2)}{my\ income}* \$ 1\ bazillion$. 

## Insert footnotes.
Because we specified footnotes in the markdown extensions in our YAML[^1], we can now include them in the text.

[^1]: This is the footnote.

# Results

This is where the results will go in a moment. For now, notice the chunk is commented out.

I have written the results section separately to keep things nice and tidy, and this is where I will call it as "child" input. 
It is important that R chunks (identifiable as sandwiched between three back ticks \`\`\`) in the child file don't have the same names as chunks in the main file.

<!-- ```{r child = 'results.Rmd'} -->
